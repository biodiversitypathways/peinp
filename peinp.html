<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Passive acoustic monitoring has proven to be a valuable tool for monitoring vocalizing species. Environmental sensors are becoming increasingly easy to program and can autonomously generating extensive data sets of the soundscape, an invaluable resource for ecological integrity monitoring. Prince Edward Island National deployed autonomous recording units (ARUs) across 38 locations during a comprehensive five-year survey. ARUs detected a total of 102 species including birds, amphibians and mammals. The analysis revealed that songbird species richness and diversity remained relatively stable, while single-species occupancy exhibited diverse patterns. Common and generalist species showed consistent occupancy, but there was a notable reduction in conifer-nesting species in 2023, likely attributed to forest structural loss. Ongoing monitoring and dynamic models can yield more detailed and predictive results to ensure the continued maintenance of ecological integrity in the Park.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Human activities have been identified as key pressures and contributors to the global decline in forest wildlife (<span class="citation" data-cites="allan2017recent">Allan et al. (<a href="#ref-allan2017recent" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). The repercussions of habitat fragmentation (<span class="citation" data-cites="fahrig2003effects">Fahrig (<a href="#ref-fahrig2003effects" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>) and loss (<span class="citation" data-cites="hanski2011habitat">Hanski (<a href="#ref-hanski2011habitat" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>), climate change (<span class="citation" data-cites="mantyka2012interactions">Mantyka-pringle, Martin, and Rhodes (<a href="#ref-mantyka2012interactions" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="sattar2021review">Sattar et al.

(<a href="#ref-abrahms2023climate" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>), and increased access to sensitive areas exert direct and indirect pressures on forest biodiversity, particularly in managed regions in Canada (<span class="citation" data-cites="lemieux2011state">Lemieux et al. (<a href="#ref-lemieux2011state" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>In 2019, Prince Edward Island National Park initiated a program incorporating autonomous recording units (ARUs) for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of the Park’s wildlife. ARUs are compact environmental sensors that are designed to passively record the environment (<span class="citation" data-cites="aru-overview">Shonfield and Bayne (<a href="#ref-aru-overview" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>), capturing vocalizing species like birds and amphibians, which is growing in use across the globe (<span class="citation" data-cites="lots-of-pam">Sugai et al. (<a href="#ref-lots-of-pam" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>). This technology enables resource managers to conduct prolonged surveys with minimal human interference. The subsequent data collected by these units contribute valuable information to ecological integrity metrics such as species richness, diversity, occupancy, and trends over time. This data aids decision-making and management within the Park. Given the rapid and ease of accumulating data from these units, maintaining a high standard of data integrity is paramount to ensure future data interoperability and sharing. <a href="https://www.wildtrax.ca">WildTrax</a> is an online platform developed by the <a href="https://abmi.ca">Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (<strong>ABMI</strong>)</a> for users of environmental sensors to help addresses these big data challenges by providing solutions to standardize, harmonize, and share data.</p>
<p>The objectives of this report are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the data management and processing procedures for the acoustic data collected from 2019 to 2024;</li>
<li>Utilize traditional human tagging, visual scanning and automated recognition techniques to detect and count species and individuals heard on recordings;</li>
<li>Define straightforward methods for evaluating species presence, species richness, and species occupancy over time at various locations;</li>
<li>Offer recommendations for ongoing monitoring approaches to contribute to the assessment of ecological integrity in forest ecosystems;</li>
<li>Facilitate data publication to the public, resource managers, academic institutions, and any other relevant agencies</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>Data were collected during the spring and summer seasons from 2019 to 2024. A total of 38 locations were surveyed over the six-year period:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 locations as part of the forest songbird monitoring program (code: <code>PENP-*</code>) with ARUs recording during the morning hours,</li>
<li>6 for Bank Swallow Monitoring (code: <code>PENP-BS-*</code>) with ARUs placed strategically beside ponds recording in the evening,</li>
<li>2 locations deployed in First Nations communities (<code>ASC-1, LXI-1</code>) to complement the forest songbird and evening schedules,</li>
<li>And one location (<code>PENP-E1</code>), which was to examine the effects of a single public event</li>
</ul>
<p>Locations were surveyed on rotation with 7 locations (PENP-1-1, PENP-1-2, PENP-3-1, PENP-3-2, PENP-4-1, PENP-4-3, PENP-4-4) surveyed each year. A detailed list of all survey years can be found in Table 1 (<a href="#tbl-loc-summary" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>) and illustrated in Figure 1 (<strong>?@fig-locs</strong>). ARUs were deployed at the beginning of the breeding season in April-May, and rotated locations until their final retrieval in July-August. At the forest songbird locations (<code>PENP-*</code>), the ARUs were set to record for 30 minutes continuously every hour for four hours, starting one hour before dawn and ending three hours after dawn. For Bank Swallow Monitoring locations (<code>PENP-BS</code>), recordings were made every 5 minutes for a duration of 3 minutes each from 1.5 hours before dusk to 1.5 hours after dusk. On average, each ARU recorded for</p>

<p>A total of 12456 recordings were collected (see <strong>?@fig-recs-collect</strong>). From 2019 - 2021, data were transferred via hard drive to the University of Alberta in Edmonton, where they are redundantly stored on a server known as Cirrus. The recordings were standardized to ensure adherence to the naming convention of <code>LOCATION_DATETIME</code>, such as <code>PENP-1-1_20230625_053500.wav</code>. The remaining recordings (2022 - 2023) were directly uploaded to WildTrax by Parks Canada staff and can be downloaded from the platform’s Recording tab, accessible under Manage &gt; Download list of recordings (see <a href="#fig-download-recs" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-data-processing">Community data processing</h2>
<p>The principal goal for data processing was to describe the acoustic community of species heard at locations while choosing a large enough subset of recordings for analyses. To ensure balanced replication, for each location and year surveyed, four randomly selected recordings were processed for 3-minutes between the hours of 4:00 AM - 7:59 AM ideally on four separate dates (see <a href="#tbl-loc-repl" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a>). Four recordings will ensure that we have the minimum number of samples for a simple occupancy analysis (<span class="citation" data-cites="mackenzie2002estimating">Darryl I. MacKenzie et al. (<a href="#ref-mackenzie2002estimating" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="imperfect-occu">Darryl I. MacKenzie et al. (<a href="#ref-imperfect-occu" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>). Tags are made using count-removal (see <span class="citation" data-cites="farnsworth2002removal">Farnsworth et al. (<a href="#ref-farnsworth2002removal" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="time-removal">Sólymos et al. (<a href="#ref-time-removal" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>) where tags are only made at the time of first detection of each individual heard on the recordings. In case a species was overly abundant a TMTT (‘too many to tag’) flag was used (see <a href="#tbl-tmtt" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;5</a>). 1% of the total tags were TMTT but were subsequently converted to numeric using <code>wildrtrax::wt_replace_tmtt</code>. We also verified that all tags that were created were checked by a second observer (n = 5.91) to ensure accuracy of detections (see <a href="#tbl-verified" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;4</a>). Amphibian abundance was estimated at the time of first detection using the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc/science/north-american-amphibian-monitoring-program">North American Amphibian Monitoring Program</a> with abundance of species being estimated on the scale of “calling intensity index” (CI) of 1 - 3. Mammals such as Red Squirrel, were also noted on the recordings. After the data are processed in WildTrax, the <a href="https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/">wildrtrax</a> package is use to download the data into a standard format prepared for analysis. The <code>wt_download_report</code> function downloads the data directly to a R framework for easy manipulation (see <a href="https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/apis.html">wildrtrax APIs</a>).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visual-scanning">Visual scanning</h2>
<p>Visual scanning is the concept of visually examining spectrograms in order to find a signal within an audio recording. Visual scanning can be a useful processing method allowing trained users to process recordings much faster than traditional listening. It has been used for detecting different taxa (amphibians: <span class="citation" data-cites="vis-scan-amphs">Cameron et al. (<a href="#ref-vis-scan-amphs" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, mammals: <span class="citation" data-cites="aru-vs-cams-wolves">Garland et al. (<a href="#ref-aru-vs-cams-wolves" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>) with comparable biological metrics, as well as helping to maximize species detection in large acoustic monitoring data sets (<span class="citation" data-cites="all-the-scans">Ware et al. (<a href="#ref-all-the-scans" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>). WildTrax’s project settings and dynamic spectrogram settings in the processing interface allow users to upload many recordings, while also allowing frequency-limited or time-limited spectrograms. These changes are easily made by adjusting project settings in WildTrax (see <a href="#fig-project-dynamic" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>).</p>

<p>In order to use of ponds by Bank Swallow (BANS) as roosting locations at <code>PENP-BS-*</code> site, visual scanning was employed to identify the number of times vocalizations of BANS were heard at these locations. A total of 1387 recordings were visually scanned for BANS.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="automated-recognition">Automated recognition</h2>
<p>Automated recognition is a well-known process to help detect rare and elusive species (<span class="citation" data-cites="knight2019classification">Knight and Bayne (<a href="#ref-knight2019classification" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="shonfield2018utility">Shonfield, Heemskerk, and Bayne (<a href="#ref-shonfield2018utility" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>) as well as species that may have a low detectability by collecting large data sets. In order to determine the presence of a few key species-at-risk, we utilized automated recognizers and deployed them across all the recordings in the 2019 data set. We constructed a recognizer for Eastern Wood-Pewee (EAWP) and used three previously constructed Wildlife Acoustics SongScope recognizers for Olive-sided Flycatcher (OSFL), Rusty Blackbird (RUBL) and Canada Warbler (CAWA) to detect for the presence of these species in the 2019 data set. All recognizers are freely available on WildTrax under Methods and Protocols &gt; <a href="https://wildtrax.ca/resources/methods-protocols/automated-recognizers/">Automated Recognizers</a>. Hits were verified and true positives for presence at each location (recording where the species was first positively detected) were uploaded to WildTrax via the <code>wt_songscope_tags</code> function in <code>wildrtrax</code>.</p>

<section id="analyses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyses">Analyses</h2>
<p>Species richness, diversity and occupancy were calculated using the 29 forest songbird monitoring locations (<code>PENP-</code>). We calculated species richness as distinct species found at each location and year surveyed (see <a href="#fig-spp-rich-locs" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>), omitting species using <code>wildrtrax::wt_tidy_species()</code> for abiotic, amphibians, unknowns and insects. To determine if there were any changes to species diversity, we used Shannon’s diversity index (<span class="citation" data-cites="shannon1948mathematical">Shannon (<a href="#ref-shannon1948mathematical" role="doc-biblioref">1948</a>)</span>) over years using <code>vegan::diversity(index="shannon")</code> (see <a href="#fig-shannon" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>).</p>
<p>For testing species occupancy, we selected locations with a minimum of four dawn visits for each year across all five years, focusing on forest obligate species for ecological relevance (see <a href="#tbl-bird-guilds" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;6</a>). Utilizing a single-season single-species occupancy model from <span class="citation" data-cites="mackenzie2002estimating">Darryl I. MacKenzie et al. (<a href="#ref-mackenzie2002estimating" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>, we calculated the predicted occupancy of species at all locations surveyed in each year across years. Site-specific covariates included the distance to ocean edge (in meters) and the proportional area of each cover type from the <a href="https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/Environment-and-Food/OD0144-Corporate-Landuse-Inventory-2010/tc7z-7rpy">Prince Edward Island 2010 Corporate Land Use Inventory</a> at 150 meter radius surrounding the ARU categorized into anthropogenic (pavement, soy), open (grass, sand dune, bare soil), deciduous (red maple, white birch, alder, poplar) and conifer (white spruce, black spruce, balsam fir). Observation covariates incorporated day of the year, hour, observer, and a quadratic term for both day of year (<span class="math inline">\(doy^{2}\)</span>) and hour (<span class="math inline">\(hr^{2}\)</span>). See <a href="#tbl-obvs-and-covs" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> for more information. Despite variations in processing methodology between 2019 - 2021 (1SPM - species-individual detected per minute, i.e.&nbsp;repeat sampling each minute for 3 minute) and subsequent years (2022 - 2023; 1SPT), we maintained consistency by exclusively utilizing the time to the first detection of individuals from the 1SPM recordings. Model predictions were generated, with goodness-of-fit testing using methods from <span class="citation" data-cites="occu-fit">Darryl I. MacKenzie and Bailey (<a href="#ref-occu-fit" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> and the best model selected based on AIC and through <code>MuMIn::dregde</code>, <code>MuMIn::get.models</code> and <code>MuMIn::model.sel</code>. If more than one model existed, the average model was used using <code>MuMIn::model.avg</code>. The final predictions were then made and plotted over years and sorted by nesting guilds of species into conifer, deciduous, treed / shrubby and open.</p>

<p>We selected 15 species to represent the forest songbird community into 4 separate habitat nesting guilds (see <a href="#tbl-bird-guilds" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;6</a>): conifer (<strong>?@fig-spp-occ-conifer</strong>), deciduous (<strong>?@fig-spp-occ-decid</strong>), treed / shrubby (<strong>?@fig-spp-occ-tss</strong>) and open (<strong>?@fig-spp-occ-open</strong>). Analysis of species occupancy revealed diverse and varied changes across these species. Analytically, many models were singular, and a few exhibited overdispersion (indicated by <em>c-hat</em> in <strong>?@tbl-c-hat</strong>), likely due to low detections or a limited sample size of spatial locations. Ubiquitous species such as Red-eyed Vireo, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Magnolia Warbler and Northern Parula, demonstrated stable site occupancy across the years. Generalist species or those capable of capitalizing on utilizing mixed habitats, exemplified by the Northern Parula, also maintained consistent occupancy levels. The occurrence of Hurricane Fiona in 2023 led to notable breakpoints in the occupancy of certain species: coniferous species, including the Black-throated Green Warbler, Black-throated Blue Warbler, Blackburnian Warbler, Golden-crowned Kinglet, and Mourning Warbler, experiencing declines. Conversely, increases were observed in guilds of species that favor more open or shrubby habitats, such as the Alder Flycatcher and American Redstart. Thrushes (American Robin, Swainson’s Thrush, Hermit Thrush) had notably wavering occupancy throughout the years.</p>

<p>BANS were detected at r jbm |&gt; select(location) |&gt; tally() distinct locations (PENP-BS-1, PENP-BS-1-1). Given the low number of detections across the scanned data, it is unlikely that Bank Swallows are occupying areas near these ponds.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Considering the recent (2022) natural disturbance effects seen in the Park, species richness and diversity stayed relatively stable. Individuals nesting in conifer dominant stands likely moved to more suitable habitat outside the park, suggesting the potential utility of metapopulation analysis through passive acoustic monitoring outside of the park via citizen science participation.</p>
<p>Further analysis may utilize dynamic occupancy models (<span class="citation" data-cites="mackenzie2009modeling">Darryl I. MacKenzie et al. (<a href="#ref-mackenzie2009modeling" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>), multi-species multi-season occupancy models (<span class="citation" data-cites="devarajan2020multi">Devarajan, Morelli, and Tenan (<a href="#ref-devarajan2020multi" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>), or community shifts (<span class="citation" data-cites="oksanen2010canonical">Oksanen et al. (<a href="#ref-oksanen2010canonical" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>) to describe richness and diversity while accounting for decreases in species that may rely on specific habitat structures within the park. Additional geospatial assets could improve the accuracy of modelling apporaches as well. Nevertheless, this study demostrates the efficacy of autonomous recording units (ARUs) as a powerful tool for monitoring climatic and habitat shifts with a relatively low sample size and area coverage. As Avian species within the Park forest demonstrate a non-uniform distribution relative to habitat, the following recommendations for optimizing the efficiency and reliability of the ARU program include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritizing monitoring of historical locations, particularly emphasizing repeats at PENP-1-1, PENP-1-2, PENP-3-1, PENP-3-2, PENP-4-1, PENP-4-3, PENP-4-4 as baselines for evaluating ecological changes over time.</li>
<li>Adjusting monitoring times to dawn and dusk and extending deployment periods to 4-7 days between May 15 and July 15 to maximize vocalizations during peak activity periods.</li>
<li>Regular servicing of ARUs, focusing on testing microphone sensitivity degradation to ensure optimal functionality, data reliability, and longevity.</li>
<li>Continuing high-quality verification of tags to create annotated datasets for building and automating classifiers within WildTrax.</li>
<li>Data publication WildTrax can further the dissemination of information and participation of others in the park network</li>
</ul>
